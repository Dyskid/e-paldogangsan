Shopping Mall Structure Analysis Instructions
1. Analysis Scope
For each shopping mall, analyze and document the following:

Product category structure

URL patterns

Pagination methods

Dynamic loading status (whether JavaScript rendering is required)

Location of product data within the HTML structure

Use proper HTTP headers when accessing the shopping malls

2. Reference Information
Retrieve the shopping mall URL and [engname] for the given id from:
C:/Users/johndoe/Desktop/e-paldogangsan/data/malls.json

3. File Management
Save all HTML files downloaded for analysis in:
malls/[id]-[engname]/analyze/requirements/

Create a single TypeScript file named:
analyze-[id].ts
and save it in:
malls/[id]-[engname]/analyze/

Ensure that this TypeScript file generates exactly one output file named:
analysis-[id].json
and save it in:
malls/[id]-[engname]/analyze/

Create a report file named:
report-[id].md
and save it in:
malls/[id]-[engname]/analyze/
The report must clearly state whether the process was successful or not, and explain the reason.

If any of the above files already exist, overwrite them without any prompt.

4. Result Notification
After completion, print to the terminal the ID(s) for which the process was unsuccessful.
