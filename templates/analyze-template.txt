# Mall Structure Analysis Template

Please analyze the following shopping mall website and provide detailed information about its structure:

Mall Information:
- ID: {{MALL_ID}}
- Name: {{MALL_NAME}}
- URL: {{MALL_URL}}
- Region: {{MALL_REGION}}

## Tasks to Complete:

1. **Homepage Analysis**
   - Visit the homepage and identify main product categories
   - Note the overall site structure (is it a custom site, Cafe24, Godo Mall, etc.)
   - Check if the site requires login or has access restrictions

2. **Product Category Structure**
   - List all main product categories and their URLs
   - Note the URL pattern for categories (e.g., /category/123, /goods/list?cate=456)
   - Check if categories have subcategories

3. **Product Listing Pages**
   - Analyze how products are displayed in category pages
   - Identify CSS selectors for:
     - Product container/item
     - Product name
     - Product price
     - Product image
     - Product link
   - Check pagination:
     - How many products per page?
     - URL pattern for pagination (e.g., ?page=2, /p2)
     - Is there infinite scroll or AJAX loading?

4. **Product Detail Pages**
   - Visit a few product pages and note the URL pattern
   - Identify additional product information available:
     - Description
     - Multiple images
     - Options/variants
     - Stock status

5. **Technical Analysis**
   - Is the site static HTML or JavaScript-rendered?
   - Are products loaded via AJAX calls?
   - Any API endpoints discovered?
   - Character encoding (UTF-8, EUC-KR, etc.)

6. **Special Considerations**
   - Any anti-scraping measures (rate limiting, CAPTCHAs)?
   - Special headers or cookies required?
   - Mobile vs desktop differences?
