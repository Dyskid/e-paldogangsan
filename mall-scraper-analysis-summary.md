- **Issue:** The server's SSL certificate cannot be verified, preventing secure connection
- **Recommendation:** May need manual certificate acceptance or alternative access method

### ❓ Unknown Status (3 malls)

These malls have report files but no clear success/failure indicators or JSON output files:

1. **#91 haman-mall**
   - Has analyze-91.ts and report-91.md
   - No analysis-91.json file found
   - Requires manual verification

2. **#92 gimhae-on-mall**
   - Has analyze-92.ts and report-92.md
   - No analysis-92.json file found
   - Requires manual verification

3. **#93 e-jeju-mall**
   - Has analyze-93.ts and report-93.md
   - No analysis-93.json file found
   - Requires manual verification

### ⚠️ Missing Reports (7 malls)

   - Primary cause of failures
   - Affects government sites with self-signed certificates

2. **Redirect Issues** (2 occurrences)
   - Some malls use complex redirect chains
   - May require following redirects or using specific entry points

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Complete Missing Analyses** (Priority: High)
   - Analyze the 7 malls without reports
   - Focus on Jeolla Province malls (#52, #53, #55, #57-60)

2. **Resolve SSL Issues** (Priority: High)
   - Implement certificate bypass for mall #66
   - Consider using puppeteer with `ignoreHTTPSErrors: true`

3. **Verify Unknown Status** (Priority: Medium)
   - Check malls #91, #92, #93 for actual schema generation
   - May need to re-run analysis with better error handling

### Technical Improvements

1. **Standardize Output**
   - Ensure all successful analyses generate `analysis-{id}.json` files
   - Implement consistent success/failure reporting

2. **Error Handling**
   - Add retry logic for SSL/network errors
   - Implement fallback strategies for difficult sites

3. **Batch Processing**
   - With 88% success rate, implement batch processing for remaining malls
   - Create automated retry mechanism for failed malls

## Conclusion

The scraper schema generation project has achieved an impressive **88.2% success rate**, with 82 out of 93 malls successfully analyzed. The remaining work involves:

- Analyzing 7 missing malls
- Fixing 1 SSL certificate issue
- Verifying 3 malls with unclear status

This represents approximately 1-2 days of additional work to achieve 100% coverage.
