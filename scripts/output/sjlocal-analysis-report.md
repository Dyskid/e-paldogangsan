# 세종로컬푸드 싱싱장터 (sjlocal.or.kr) Analysis Report

## Summary

The sjlocal.or.kr website is an inventory tracking system for local food markets in Sejong City, not a traditional e-commerce shopping mall.

## Key Findings

1. **No E-commerce Functionality**: The website only provides real-time inventory information for products available at physical stores
2. **No Prices**: Products do not have prices listed - it's purely an inventory tracking system
3. **No Product Images**: No product images are available
4. **No Purchase Options**: Cannot buy products online - only check availability at physical stores

## Data Collected

- **Total Products Found**: 385 unique products
- **Markets**: 5 physical store locations (도담점, 아름점, 새롬점, 도도리파크, 소담점)
- **Product Information Available**:
  - Product name
  - Category/Product group
  - Current stock status
  - Store location

## Product Categories

Main categories include:
- 베이비채소 (Baby vegetables)
- 쌈채소 (Wrap vegetables)
- 나물류 (Seasoned vegetables)
- 반찬류 (Side dishes)
- 즉석식품 (Instant foods)

## Conclusion

Since the website does not provide:
- Product prices
- Product images
- Online purchase functionality

**These products cannot be registered in the e-Paldogangsan system** as they do not meet the minimum requirements for product registration (must have extractable prices).

The sjlocal.or.kr site serves as an inventory checker for customers to verify product availability before visiting physical stores, rather than as an online shopping platform.
