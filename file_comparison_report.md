# File Comparison Report: Rename Script Conflicts

## Summary
Based on the rename script analysis, several files would have conflicting names after renaming. This report analyzes these conflicts to determine if the files contain duplicate or different data.

## 1. Cham-Dalseong (참달성) Conflicts

### Files that would map to: `2-cham-dalseong-dalseong-county-analysis-final.json`

**Original files:**
- `chamds-analysis-final.json` (2,118 bytes) - EXISTS
- `chamdalseong-analysis-final.json` - NOT FOUND

**Existing renamed file:**
- `2-cham-dalseong-dalseong-county-analysis-final.json` (3,153 bytes) - EXISTS

**Content Analysis:**
- `chamds-analysis-final.json`: Analysis of chamds.com showing it redirects to Naver Smart Store
- `2-cham-dalseong-dalseong-county-analysis-final.json`: Analysis of the Naver Smart Store itself showing access blocked due to rate limiting

**Conclusion:** These are DIFFERENT analyses - one for the original website and one for the Naver store it redirects to. Both files contain valuable information about different stages of accessing this mall.

## 2. E-Jeju Mall (이제주몰) Conflicts

### Files that would map to: `93-e-jeju-mall-mall-products.json`

**Original files:**
- `ejeju-mall-products.json` - NOT FOUND
- `jeju-mall-products.json` (1,060 bytes) - EXISTS

**Existing renamed file:**
- `93-e-jeju-mall-mall-products.json` (8,504 bytes) - EXISTS

**Content Analysis:**
- `jeju-mall-products.json`: Contains only 3 products with minimal data (missing prices, images, descriptions)
- `93-e-jeju-mall-mall-products.json`: Contains 16 products with complete data (prices, images, brands, categories)

**Conclusion:** These contain DIFFERENT data quality levels. The renamed file has much more complete product information. The original file appears to be an early/incomplete scrape attempt.

### Files that would map to: `93-e-jeju-mall-mall-summary.json`

**Original files:**
- `ejeju-mall-summary.json` - NOT FOUND
- `jeju-mall-summary.json` (125 bytes) - EXISTS

**Content:** Unable to analyze as the summary file is very small.

## 3. Sangju Mall (상주몰) Conflicts

### Files that would map to various `63-sangju-myeongsil-sangju-mall-*` files

**Original files found:**
- `sjmall-homepage.html` (226,289 bytes)
- `sjmall-products.json` (18,502 bytes)
- `sjmall-scrape-summary.json` (2,474 bytes)
- `sjlocal-*` files - NOT FOUND

**Existing renamed files:**
- `63-sangju-myeongsil-sangju-mall-homepage.html` (87,280 bytes)
- `63-sangju-myeongsil-sangju-mall-products.json` (236,058 bytes)
- `63-sangju-myeongsil-sangju-mall-scrape-summary.json` (1,201 bytes)

**Content Analysis:**
- `sjmall-products.json`: Contains products from sjmall.cyso.co.kr (명실상주몰) with proper product data
- `63-sangju-myeongsil-sangju-mall-products.json`: Contains products from sjlocal.or.kr (세종로컬푸드) - WRONG MALL DATA

**Critical Finding:** The renamed file with ID 63 contains data from the WRONG mall (Sejong Local Food instead of Sangju Mall). This is a data integrity issue.

## Findings Summary

1. **Cham-Dalseong files**: Different stages of analysis (website vs Naver store) - both valuable
2. **E-Jeju files**: Different data quality levels - renamed file is more complete
3. **Sangju files**: CRITICAL ERROR - renamed file contains wrong mall data (Sejong instead of Sangju)

## Recommendations

1. **Preserve both Cham-Dalseong files** as they document different access attempts
2. **Keep the more complete E-Jeju file** (93-e-jeju-mall-mall-products.json)
3. **URGENT: Fix Sangju mall data** - the current ID 63 files contain Sejong data, not Sangju data
4. **Review the rename script mappings** to ensure correct mall associations

## Data Integrity Issues Found

- Mall ID 63 (Sangju) files contain data from Sejong Local Food (sjlocal.or.kr)
- This suggests the rename script may have incorrect mappings for some malls
- Original sjmall files contain the correct Sangju mall data
