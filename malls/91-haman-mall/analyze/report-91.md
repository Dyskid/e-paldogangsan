# Analysis Report for 함안몰 (ID: 91)

## Status: Partially Successful

### Summary
The analysis of 함안몰 (hamanmall.com) was partially successful. The site structure was identified, but complete product extraction would require JavaScript execution capabilities.

### Key Findings

1. **Platform**: The site is built on FirstMall e-commerce platform
2. **Dynamic Content**: Products are loaded dynamically via JavaScript/AJAX
3. **URL Structure**:
   - Categories: `/goods/catalog?code=XXXX`
   - Product details: `/goods/view?no=XXXX`

### Categories Found
- 농축산물 (Agricultural products)
- 가공식품 (Processed foods)
- 공예품 (Crafts)
- 건강식품 (Health foods)

### Technical Challenges
1. **JavaScript Requirement**: The site heavily relies on JavaScript for content rendering
2. **AJAX Loading**: Product listings are loaded dynamically after initial page load
3. **No Static Product Data**: Product information is not available in the initial HTML response

### Recommendations
To fully scrape this site, you would need:
1. A headless browser (like Puppeteer or Playwright) to execute JavaScript
2. Wait for AJAX requests to complete before extracting data
3. Monitor network requests to identify the actual API endpoints for product data

### Files Created
- HTML samples saved in `requirements/` directory
- Analysis TypeScript file: `analyze-91.ts`
- Analysis result would be in: `analysis-91.json` (after running the TypeScript file)
