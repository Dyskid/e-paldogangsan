# Analysis Report for Taebaek Mall (강원태백몰)

## Status: ❌ Unsuccessful

### Reason
The Taebaek Mall (강원태백몰) uses the Firstmall e-commerce platform, which relies heavily on JavaScript to dynamically load product data. Static scraping methods cannot retrieve product information because:

1. **Dynamic Content Loading**: Product listings are loaded via JavaScript after the initial page load
2. **Empty Category Pages**: When accessing category URLs directly, the returned HTML does not contain product data
3. **Client-Side Rendering**: The platform uses JavaScript to fetch and render product information dynamically

### Technical Details
- **Platform**: Firstmall
- **URL Structure**: Uses `/goods/catalog?code={categoryCode}` pattern
- **Category Codes Found**: 
  - 00160001
  - 0014
- **Limited category structure available without JavaScript execution**

### Attempted Methods
1. Direct HTTP requests to homepage ✓ (structure identified)
2. Category page scraping ✗ (no product data)
3. Static HTML analysis ✗ (requires JavaScript)

### Recommendations
To successfully scrape this mall, you would need to:
1. Use a headless browser (Puppeteer or Playwright) to execute JavaScript
2. Wait for dynamic content to load before extracting data
3. Monitor network requests to identify API endpoints
4. Consider requesting official data access from the mall administrator

### Files Generated
