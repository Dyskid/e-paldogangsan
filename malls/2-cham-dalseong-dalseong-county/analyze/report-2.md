# Analysis Report for 참달성 (달성군) - Mall ID 2

## Summary
**Status: FAILED** - Unable to access the shopping mall due to rate limiting (HTTP 429 - Too Many Requests).

## Details

### Mall Information
- **Mall ID**: 2
- **Mall Name**: 참달성 (달성군)
- **Base URL**: https://smartstore.naver.com/chamdalseong
- **Platform**: Naver Smart Store

### Analysis Results
The analysis process encountered rate limiting issues:

1. **Initial Attempt**: Successfully accessed the store and found 7 product categories
   - 쌀, 곡물
   - 농산물
   - 음료 · 차
   - 가공식품
   - 건강식품
   - 뷰티소품
   - 전체상품

2. **Subsequent Attempts**: All further attempts were blocked with HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) error
   - Error message: "너무 많은 요청을 하셨습니다" (You have made too many requests)
   - Retry attempts with delays (30 seconds) were also blocked

3. **Data Collection**: Due to rate limiting after initial success:
   - Product categories were successfully discovered (7 categories)
   - No sample products could be collected
   - Pagination was detected but could not be fully analyzed

### Technical Details
- **JavaScript Required**: Yes (Naver Smart Store requires JavaScript rendering)
- **Analysis Method**: Used Playwright for browser automation
- **Error Type**: HTTP 429 - Rate Limiting
- **Response Status**: 200 on first attempt, 429 on subsequent attempts

### Potential Causes
1. Naver Smart Store has aggressive rate limiting for automated requests
2. IP-based rate limiting triggered after initial successful access
3. May require longer delays between requests (> 30 seconds)
4. Could require session management or authentication

### Recommendations
1. Implement exponential backoff strategy with longer delays (5-10 minutes)
2. Use rotating proxies or VPN to avoid IP-based rate limiting
3. Consider accessing the store during off-peak hours
4. Implement session persistence to maintain cookies between requests
5. Manual verification shows the store is active and accessible via regular browser

### Files Generated
- `analyze-2.ts`: Analysis script with improved error handling and retry logic
- `analysis-2.json`: Generated with partial data (categories found, but no products)
- Multiple HTML files and screenshots showing both success and rate limit pages

## Conclusion
The analysis was partially successful. The store is confirmed to be active and we successfully identified its category structure. However, detailed product analysis was prevented by Naver's rate limiting mechanisms. The store uses standard Naver Smart Store structure with JavaScript-rendered content.
