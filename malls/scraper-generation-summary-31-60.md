## Files Generated per Mall
Each successful scraper directory contains:
- `scraper-[id].ts` - Main scraper implementation
- `config.json` - Configuration settings
- `package.json` - Project dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `README.md` - Usage documentation
- `report-[id].md` - Generation report

## Next Steps
1. Manually fix the analysis files for malls 41 and 54
2. Re-run the scraper generation for failed malls
3. Test the generated scrapers with sample runs
4. Deploy scrapers to production environment

## Technical Notes
- All scrapers use axios for HTTP requests and cheerio for HTML parsing
- Scrapers handle both structured and unstructured product data
- Rate limiting is implemented with 2-second delays between requests
