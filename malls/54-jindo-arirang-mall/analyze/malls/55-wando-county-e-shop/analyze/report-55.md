# Wando County E-Shop Analysis Report

## Summary

The analysis of the Wando County E-Shop (완도군 이숍) at https://wandofood.go.kr/ was **successful**. The website structure was successfully analyzed and documented.

## Key Findings

### Platform & Technology
- **Platform**: Cafe24 e-commerce platform
- **JavaScript Requirement**: Heavy JavaScript usage for dynamic content loading
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design with mobile-optimized layout

### Website Structure
- **Categories**: 6 main categories identified
  - 완도전복 (Wando Abalone) - ID: 744
  - 해조류 (Seaweed) - ID: 745
  - 수산물 (Seafood) - ID: 746
  - 농산물 (Agricultural Products) - ID: 747
  - 간편식품 (Convenience Foods) - ID: 801
  - 소상공인 선물꾸러미 (Small Business Gift Sets) - ID: 806

### Product Display
- **Products per page**: 12 items
- **Pagination**: Traditional page number system using query parameter `?page=N`
- **Maximum pages**: 28 pages found in the 완도전복 category

### URL Patterns
- **Category URL**: `/category/{categoryName}/{categoryId}/`
- **Product URL**: `/product/{productName}/{productId}/category/{categoryId}/display/1/`
- **Pagination**: `?page={pageNumber}`

### Data Extraction
Successfully extracted sample products with:
- Product IDs (numeric format, e.g., 5630, 5629)
- Product names (Korean text with detailed descriptions)
- Prices (formatted in Korean Won, e.g., "33,900원")
- Product images (CDN URLs with authentication tokens)
- Product URLs (following Cafe24 URL structure)

## Technical Considerations

1. **JavaScript Rendering**: The site heavily relies on JavaScript for functionality
2. **Authentication Tokens**: Image URLs include authentication tokens that may expire
3. **Product Options**: Many products have additional options requiring selection
4. **Cart Functionality**: Uses JavaScript-based cart addition functions
5. **Like/Wishlist**: Includes social features for product likes and wishlists

## Challenges & Solutions

1. **HTML Structure**: The site uses nested spans with inline styles for product information
   - Solution: Used CSS selectors with style attributes to target specific elements
   - Selected the last matching element to get actual content vs. labels

2. **Dynamic Content**: Some content may be loaded dynamically via AJAX
   - Solution: Analyzed static HTML structure first, dynamic content would require browser automation

3. **Complex URLs**: Product URLs include Korean text which may need encoding
   - Solution: URLs are already properly encoded in the HTML

## Files Generated

1. **HTML Files** (saved in `requirements/` directory):
   - `homepage.html` - Main page
   - `category_abalone.html` - 완도전복 category page
   - `category_abalone_page2.html` - Page 2 of 완도전복 category
   - `category_seaweed.html` - 해조류 category page
   - `category_seafood.html` - 수산물 category page
   - `product_detail.html` - Sample product detail page

2. **Analysis Files**:
   - `analyze-55.ts` - TypeScript analysis script
   - `analyze-55.js` - Compiled JavaScript
   - `analysis-55.json` - Structured analysis results

## Recommendations

1. **Web Scraping**: For actual data extraction, consider using:
   - Puppeteer or Playwright for JavaScript rendering
   - Respect robots.txt and implement rate limiting
   - Handle authentication token expiration for images

2. **Data Updates**: The site appears to be actively maintained with new products
   - Implement regular checks for new categories or structural changes
   - Monitor for changes in URL patterns or HTML structure

3. **Performance**: With 28+ pages per category and 6 categories, full site scraping would involve:
   - Minimum 168 page requests for all category pages
   - Additional requests for product details
   - Consider implementing parallel processing with rate limits

## Conclusion

The analysis successfully mapped the structure of the Wando County E-Shop, identifying all key elements needed for data extraction. The Cafe24 platform provides a consistent structure that should be reliable for automated data collection, though JavaScript rendering capabilities would be required for full functionality.
