# Analysis Report for Jeongseon Mall (정선몰)

## Status: ❌ Unsuccessful

### Reason
The Jeongseon Mall (정선몰) uses the Firstmall e-commerce platform, which relies heavily on JavaScript to dynamically load product data. Static scraping methods cannot retrieve product information because:

1. **Dynamic Content Loading**: Product listings are loaded via JavaScript after the initial page load
2. **Empty Category Pages**: When accessing category URLs directly, the returned HTML does not contain product data
3. **Client-Side Rendering**: The platform appears to use AJAX calls to fetch and render product information

### Technical Details
- **Platform**: Firstmall
- **URL Structure**: Uses `/goods/catalog?code={categoryCode}` pattern
- **Category Codes Found**: 
  - 0001 (농산물)
  - 0002 (건강식품)
  - 0003 (음료)
  - 0007 (과자/베이커리)
  - 0008 (축산물)

### Attempted Methods
1. Direct HTTP requests to homepage ✓ (structure identified)
2. Category page scraping ✗ (empty content)
3. Search functionality test ✗ (requires JavaScript)

### Recommendations
To successfully scrape this mall, you would need to:
1. Use a headless browser (Puppeteer or Playwright) to execute JavaScript
2. Wait for dynamic content to load before extracting data
3. Monitor network requests to identify API endpoints
4. Consider requesting official data access from the mall administrator
