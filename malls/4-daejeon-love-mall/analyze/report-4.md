# Analysis Report - 대전사랑몰 (Daejeon Love Mall)

## Analysis Status: **SUCCESSFUL** ✅

## Summary
The analysis of 대전사랑몰 (ID: 4) has been successfully completed. The shopping mall uses the ezwel.com e-commerce platform with dynamic content loading via AJAX.

## Key Findings

### 1. Platform
- **Platform**: ezwel.com welfare shopping mall system
- **Base URL**: https://ontongdaejeon.ezwel.com/onnuri/main
- **Technology**: jQuery-based with AJAX dynamic loading

### 2. Category Structure
The mall uses a hierarchical category system with the following main categories:
- 대전 로컬상품관 (Daejeon Local Products) - 3 levels deep
- 특가 ON (Special Offers)
- 농산물 (Agricultural Products)
- 수산물 (Seafood Products)
- 대전우수 상품판매장 (Daejeon Premium Products)

Categories are accessed via numeric IDs (e.g., 100101714, 100100868, etc.)

### 3. Product Listing
- **Container**: `.goodsList#goodsListItem`
- **Items**: Loaded dynamically via AJAX
- **Pagination**: Standard pagination with configurable items per page (20, 40, 60, 80, 100)
- **Sorting Options**: Sales volume, reviews, newest, price (low to high/high to low)

### 4. URL Patterns
- **Category List**: `/onnuri/goods/goodsSearchList?ctgrNo={categoryId}`
- **Product Detail**: `/onnuri/goods/detail?goodsCd={productId}&ctgrCd={categoryId}`
- **Search**: `/onnuri/goods/list`
- **Pagination**: Appends `&pageNo={pageNumber}&pageRecordCount={itemsPerPage}`

### 5. Dynamic Loading
- **Required**: Yes - products are loaded via AJAX after page load
- **Method**: POST requests to `/onnuri/goods/goodsSearchList`
- **Data Format**: Form-encoded parameters (ctgrNo, pageNo, pageRecordCount, etc.)

### 6. Data Extraction Selectors
- **Product ID**: `data-goodsCd` attribute or `tag` attribute
- **Product Name**: `.ellipsis_2` text content
- **Price**: `.price span` text content
- **Image**: `img.lazy` with `data-src` or `src` attribute
- **Seller**: `.market_name` or extracted from product details

## Technical Notes
1. The site uses lazy loading for images
2. Multiple jQuery versions are loaded (1.9.1 and 1.12.4)
3. Product data is not present in initial HTML - requires AJAX calls
4. The platform appears to support both B2C and B2B operations
5. Session-based authentication may be required for some features

## Recommendations for Scraping
1. Use session management to maintain cookies
2. Implement proper delays between requests to avoid rate limiting
3. Handle AJAX responses which return full HTML pages rather than JSON
4. Parse dynamic content after JavaScript execution
5. Monitor for changes in category IDs as they appear to be system-generated

## Conclusion
The analysis was successful. The 대전사랑몰 uses a standard ezwel.com platform with predictable patterns for categories, products, and pagination. The main challenge is handling the dynamic AJAX-based content loading.
